q 9

q 10 (need to know abt elasticity)
	* Percentage change in quanity / percentage change in price
	

q 11 (asks equilibrium price but he could also ask equilibrium quantity)
	when you do these questions, plug your answer back into both equations to make sure your answers are equal

	q 12, q13,

q 14 (deadweight loss) make sure to know bc hardest q on the exam

q15 Make sure to know the graph questions. He doesn't really change them so they will be the same likely but know the
	content

q18 its a production function, but could be a cobb douglas production function which has a different process (will be cobb
	douglas on exam)

q19

	will either be the same or short run costs will be higher

equilibrium problem

cost minimization problem

slope of the iso problem

short run profit maximization problem

all 3 iso quan questions

technical rate of sub question

returns to scale
	anything other than cobb douglas, always be constant returns to scale cobb douglas depends on exponent summation

what happens to average cost if you have increasing

	decreasing, up
	xxxxxx, stays the same

the relationship between interest rates on taxable and non taxable bonds
